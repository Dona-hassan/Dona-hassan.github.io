        <h1 id="heading1">Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Celebrate 91th National Day</h1>
        <p> The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s leadership and people will celebrate tomorrow, Wednesday,
             <em><strong>September 23, 2020</strong></em>, the 90th National Day of Saudi Arabia, after the historical 
             announcement of the late King Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al Saud of Saudi Arabia’s 
             unification under "There is no god but Allah; Muhammad is the Messenger 
             of Allah" banner.</p>

        <p>Saudi National Day is the day on which the late founder named the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
             throughout the country, after 32 years of wars. On that day, a young country was 
             established that prided itself by the application of the Islamic Sharia and its 
             preservation of human values, promoting peace and goodness and in search of 
             knowledge and development towards a better future for its people, 
             the Islamic nation and the whole world.</p>

        <p>King Abdulaziz ordered at the beginning of structuring Saudi Arabia to pay great
             attention to the Two Holy Mosques and their expansion and to serving pilgrims 
             and Umrah performers, as well as establishing schools and hospitals, building 
             villages, rehabilitating the soil, and exploring irrigation water in order to 
             support agriculture.</p>

        <p>Then, King Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud was the first to follow this approach and to 
            work within its framework until the features of progress emerged and the structures
             of a number of basic institutions and agencies in the country were completed.</p> 

        <p>In the era of the pioneer of Islamic solidarity, who succeeded King Saud, King
             Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, achieving accomplishments continued, and during 
             his reign, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia began the implementation of the ambitious 
             five-year plans for development.</p> 
             
        <p>In the reign of King Khalid bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, building and growth continued to
             serve the country and citizens in particular and Islam and Muslims in general. 
             The development plans also connected with each other for the sake of achieving more
              prosperity and stability.</p>
              
        <p>The achievements during the reign of King Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud were characterized
             by comprehensiveness and integration to form a comprehensive development process for 
             building a nation and a wise and unique leadership that embodied many qualities that 
             he had, the most prominent of which was his adherence to the holy Quran and prophetic 
             Sunnah, and his dedication to serving his homeland, citizens, the Islamic nation and 
             the entire humankind.</p>
             
        <p>During the era of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud,
             the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia witnessed more giant developmental achievements throughout the 
             nation in various sectors, including education, health, transportation, industry, electricity,
              water, agriculture and the economy.</p>
              
        <p>Today, Saudi Arabia witnesses a distinguished present, looking forward to a more distinguished 
            future full of confidence in the title of the stage, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King 
            Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who has been making, since the beginning of his reign, an effort to 
            advance Saudi Arabia. The activities varied in various fields at regional and international levels,
             preceded by accomplishments at various stages during his reign in many positions.</p>  
             
        <p>Today, Saudi Arabia’s National Day passes by while we live in a bright reality established by the late
             founder King Abdulaziz.<sub>Source:SPA</sub></p>
